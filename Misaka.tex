\section{Introduction}

The name of our platform, Misaka, comes from "Misaka Network" in the light novel, manga and anime series, A Certain Magical Index, and its side-story mangas and anime series, A Certain Scientific Railgun and A Certain Scientific Accelerator. The Misaka Network is a brainwave network formed between the Sisters. The Sisters are Mikoto Misaka's 20,000 clones, who can share their thoughts and memories within their communication network. Misaka Network is actually a strongly-connected distributed network. One of our platform's typical applications is verifing distributed algorithms in a decentralized network, so we choose Misaka to be our product's name.

We design two different version of Misaka: the commercial version and the explorer version. 

The commercial version is Swarm robots, equiped with onmi-wheels and stepper motors, and can move holonomicly and precisely. Distributed algorithms researchers can ultilize it as a fully decentralized hardware platform to test newly raised algorithms, also a visualization platform of all kinds of consensus algorithms. Furthermore, teachers can use it as great tool to visualize dynamic multiple scatterplots, and to explain theorys to their students. 

The explorer version is for those researchers who want to develop tabletop swarm robots of their own. This version is a single PCB, which integrates almost all functionalities needed to develop any kinds of swarm interfaces of many porpose.

Both version have the ability of adding suitable extensions on it. We also provide models adding function to it, such as computer vision, wifi, machine learning algorithms, etc.

\section{Interaction Design}



\section{Hardware Design}

To make our hardware more universal, we design two different version of Misaka: the commercial version and the explorer version.

\subsection{Commercial version}

The commercial version aims at HRI applications, as well as algorithms development and visualization senarios. It is small custom-made robot as shown in Fig{fig:CommercialVersion}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{DA4A4015.JPG}
  \caption{The commercial version}
  \label{fig:CommercialVersion}
\end{figure}

The commercial version consists of a 3D printed frame, custom designed PCB, battery, omni-directional wheels and micro stepper motors.

The frame is printed using PLA(Polylactic Acid). It is carefully designed to fit the motors, wheels, and the PCB. The 3D Model of it is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:Frame}, and the CAD detail is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:CAD}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Frame.png}
  \caption{3D Model of the Frame}
  \label{fig:Frame}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Bottom.pdf}
  \caption{the CAD of the Frame}
  \label{fig:CAD}
\end{figure}

Its dimensions are 100 mm in diameter and 50 mm in height. Each robot is powered by a 450mAh 2S 7.4V LiPo battery. Most of the power in the robots are consumed by the motors. The current draw of each robot is approximately 100 mA when the motors are stalled and 800 mA during typical use. Thus, with a 450 mAh battery, robots are capable of moving for half an hour, and can work even longer with BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy). 

Three 38-mm-diameter omni-directional wheels are driven by micro stepper motors to precisely control the rotation angle of each wheel. To drive the robot, a motor driver chip (DRV8825) and three 2-phase 4-wire Stepper Gear Motor are used. With this combination, the robot has a maximum speed of approximately 20 cm/s. The holonomic system allows the robots to move precisely and can easily respond to user interaction. The shape of holonomic chassis is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:ChassisRender}, and the real picture of it is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:chassis}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Assembled.png}
  \caption{Chassis render}
  \label{fig:ChassisRender}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Bottom-v3.jpg}
  \caption{The holonomic chassis}
  \label{fig:chassis}
\end{figure}

The commercial version main circuit board is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:MainPCB}. The main processors onboard is a AVR microcontrollers(Microchip ATmega2560-16AU) that combines 86 general purpose I/O lines, 32 general purpose working registers, PWM, 4 USARTs, 16-channel 10-bit A/D converter, and a JTAG interface for on-chip debugging. ATmega2560 manages most logic computation.


\begin{figure}[h]

  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{MainPCB.png}

\end{figure}

The PCB schematic is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:MainPCBschematic}, layout is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:MainPCBlayout}

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

Eight independently WS2812B LED on PCB illuminated in full RGB using are wrapped inside the 3D printed enclosure to provide the robot’s state display as well as full color indicating, shown in Fig~\ref{fig:RGB}.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \caption{The RGB LED}
  \label{fig:RGB}
\end{figure}

Now robots communicates with each other using Digi XBee module. XBee supports mesh networking which can be decentralized. We can use this feature to develop and test distributed algorithms which are also decentralized.

Users can modify the robot for their applications by designing custom modules that attach to its core module or adding powerful chips and development boards to achieve more functions, such as computer vision, wifi, machine learning algorithms, etc. Currently its compatible extensions are shown in Fig~\ref{fig:extensions}. For example, in order to give Misaka Linux development environment and capabilities of testing machine learning algorithms, we add Nvidia Jetson Nano to Misaka core through UART for high-level control and image processing. And to connect them with bluetooth and wifi, we add ESP32 modules which also interact with Misaka through serial communication.\cite{zhang2020misaka}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{DA4A3991.JPG}
  \caption{Currently compatible extensions}
  \label{fig:extensions}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Explorer version}

For those researchers who want to develop distributed algorithms or tabletop swarm robots of their own, we provide an open-source PCB. 

It supports four kinds of different communication protocols, and integrates easy-to-use programmer and debug connector. To drive the stepper motor and DC motor, we have Powerstep01 on board with necessary components.
To extend its function, we provide a universal interface which can communicate with other development board such as Nvidia Jetson NANO.

All functionalities on board is shown below:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Mega2560-16AU main MCU
  \item ATMega16U2 USB-UART
  \item USB Type C port
  \item PowerStep stepper motor and DC motor drive
  \item 9 x WS2812B RGB-LED full-color light display
  \item Downward looking infrared camera with dot paper for positioning
  \item XBee3, the main Mesh network communication
  \item Espressif ESP32, provides WiFi 5, Bluetooth, BLE communication
  \item CP2102. We can burn programs through USB Type C port
  \item External battery power supply
  \item USB port power supply
  \item Buck DC-DC and impulse back pressure overvoltage and overcurrent protection
  \item Programmable pins for testing
  \item Support UART, I2C, SPI communication protocol expansion interface
\end{itemize}

The PCB schematic is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:Explorer-schematic}, layout is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:Explorer-layout}, and its 3D model in Fig~\ref{fig:3Dmodel}. After SMT, the PCB is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:PCBSMT}.

\section{Future RTLS with Bluetooth 5.1}

Real-time location systems (RTLS) are used to track and identify the location of objects in real time using "Nodes" or "tags" attached to, or embedded in, the objects tracked, and "Readers" that receive and process the wireless signals from these tags to determine their locations.\cite{costs2009real}

The Bluetooth SIG presented Bluetooth 5.1 in January 2019. With Angle of Arrival (AoA) and Angle of Departure (AoD) which are used for location and tracking of devices, we can simply use BLE 5.1 as both communication and positioning methods.

Those techniques requires one of the two communicating devices to have an array of multiple antennae, with the antenna array included in the receiving device when the AoA method is used and in the transmitting device when using AoD, as shown in Fig~\ref{fig:AODAOE}.\cite{woolley2019bluetooth}

With Bluetooth 5.1, we are able to track Misaka with a small margin of location error, as low as 10cm. The accuracy will be enough for many swarm applications.

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion}

We present Misaka, a versatile swarm robotics platform for swarm user interface development.

We hope that this paper and Misaka platform will spur more research and creativity in the swarm user interface.

All necessary material and documentation for implementing Misaka can be found at Github.
