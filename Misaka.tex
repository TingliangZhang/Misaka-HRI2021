\section{Introduction}

\section{Hardware Design}

To make our hardware more universal, we design two different version of Misaka: the commercial version and the explorer version.

\subsection{Commercial version}

The commercial version aims at HRI applications, as well as algorithms development and visualization senarios. It is small custom-made robot as shown in Fig{fig:CommercialVersion}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{DA4A4015.JPG}
  \caption{The commercial version}
  \label{fig:CommercialVersion}
\end{figure}

The commercial version consists of a 3D printed frame, custom designed PCB, battery, omni-directional wheels and micro stepper motors.

The frame is printed using PLA(Polylactic Acid). It is carefully designed to fit the motors, wheels, and the PCB. The 3D Model of it is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:Frame}, and the CAD detail is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:CAD}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Frame.png}
  \caption{3D Model of the Frame}
  \label{fig:Frame}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Bottom.pdf}
  \caption{the CAD of the Frame}
  \label{fig:CAD}
\end{figure}

Its dimensions are 100 mm in diameter and 50 mm in height. Each robot is powered by a 450mAh 2S 7.4V LiPo battery. Most of the power in the robots are consumed by the motors. The current draw of each robot is approximately 100 mA when the motors are stalled and 800 mA during typical use. Thus, with a 450 mAh battery, robots are capable of moving for half an hour, and can work even longer with BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy). 

Three 38-mm-diameter omni-directional wheels are driven by micro stepper motors to precisely control the rotation angle of each wheel. The holonomic system allows the robots to move precisely and can easily respond to user interaction. The shape of holonomic chassis is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:ChassisRender}, and the real picture of it is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:chassis}.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Assembled.png}

  \label{fig:ChassisRender}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Bottom-v3.jpg}
  \caption{The holonomic chassis}
  \label{fig:chassis}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Explorer version}

For those researchers who want to develop distributed algorithms or tabletop swarm robots of their own, we provide an open-source PCB. 
It supports four kinds of different communication protocols, and integrates easy-to-use programmer and debug connector. To drive the stepper motor and DC motor, we have Powerstep01 on board with necessary components.
To extend its function, we provide a universal interface which can communicate with other development board such as Nvidia Jetson NANO.

All functionalities on board is shown below:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Mega2560-16AU main MCU
  \item ATMega16U2 USB-UART
  \item USB Type C port
  \item PowerStep stepper motor and DC motor drive
  \item 9 x WS2812B RGB-LED full-color light display
  \item Downward looking infrared camera with dot paper for positioning
  \item XBee3, the main Mesh network communication
  \item Espressif ESP32, provides WiFi 5, Bluetooth, BLE communication
  \item CP2102. We can burn programs through USB Type C port
  \item External battery power supply
  \item USB port power supply
  \item Buck DC-DC and impulse back pressure overvoltage and overcurrent protection
  \item Programmable pins for testing
  \item Support UART, I2C, SPI communication protocol expansion interface
\end{itemize}

The PCB schematic is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:Explorer-schematic}, layout is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:Explorer-layout}, and its 3D model in Fig~\ref{fig:3Dmodel}. After SMT, the PCB is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:PCBSMT}.

\section{Future RTLS with Bluetooth 5.1}

Real-time location systems (RTLS) are used to track and identify the location of objects in real time using "Nodes" or "tags" attached to, or embedded in, the objects tracked, and "Readers" that receive and process the wireless signals from these tags to determine their locations.\cite{costs2009real}

The Bluetooth SIG presented Bluetooth 5.1 in January 2019. With Angle of Arrival (AoA) and Angle of Departure (AoD) which are used for location and tracking of devices, we can simply use BLE 5.1 as both communication and localization methods.
