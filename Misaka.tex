  A clear and well-documented \LaTeX\ document is presented as an
  article formatted for publication by ACM in a conference proceedings
  or journal publication. Based on the ``acmart'' document class, this
  article presents and explains many of the common variations, as well
  as many of the formatting elements an author may use in the
  preparation of the documentation of their work.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Future RTLS with Bluetooth 5.1}

Real-time location systems (RTLS) are used to track and identify the location of objects in real time using "Nodes" or "tags" attached to, or embedded in, the objects tracked, and "Readers" that receive and process the wireless signals from these tags to determine their locations.\cite{costs2009real}

The Bluetooth SIG presented Bluetooth 5.1 in January 2019. With Angle of Arrival (AoA) and Angle of Departure (AoD) which are used for location and tracking of devices, we can simply use BLE 5.1 as both communication and localization methods.

%% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment
%% (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures the proper
%% identification of the section in the article metadata, and the
%% consistent spelling of the heading.
\begin{acks}
